Based on the Book by Jez Humble and David Farley

### Continuous Integration

- On every commit, entire app is built, and tested against. Failures are fixed immediately.

- CI Pipeline
    - Runs on every commit with little or no delay (p55, p63).
    - CI should ideally take about 90 seconds, about five minutes is good, but never any longer than 10 minutes (p61).
    - Notifies you of success or failure (p63).

- Version Control
    - Big or small, every project gets version controlled (p56).
